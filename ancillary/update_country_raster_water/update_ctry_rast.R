#Objective: The fao_ctry_rast.bil is used to define valid country boundaries in moirai. However, this file
# does not include boundaries for inland water bodies (For example- Lake victoria). To add in boundaries
# for water bodies, we update the original raster with an additional shape file (GCAM_32_w_Taiwan.shp).
# We map in the moirai fao codes to the ISO numbers in the shape file and then combine this with the original raster
# to fill in holes
