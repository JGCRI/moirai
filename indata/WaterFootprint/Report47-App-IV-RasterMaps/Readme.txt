
Every folder contains: 4 raster files and 4 layer files for 
	the green, blue, grey and total water footprint in mm/yr (Appendix IV of Report 47)

- WF_bl_mmyr - blue water footorint in mm/yr
- WF_gn_mmyr - green water footorint in mm/yr
- WF_gy_mmyr - grey water footorint in mm/yr
- WF_tot_mmyr - total water footorint in mm/yr

Appendix VI. Global water footprint maps for selected crops (1996-2005)
The maps show the water footprints of crops on a spatial resolution level of 5 by 5 arc minute. The data shown
are averages over the period 1996-2005. The data are shown in mm/yr and have been calculated by dividing the
total water footprint per grid cell (in m3/yr) by the area of the grid cell.
